# Functional Specifications

## Background
A recommendation engine is a type of machine learning which offers relevant suggestions to customers. It finds applications in various sectors such as e-commerce, media and entertainment (ex. Netflix, Amazon). 
There are two major approaches for recommendation systems: 
* content-based: recommend items to a user that are similar to the ones the user preferred in the past
* collaborative: predict users’ preferences by analyzing relationships between users and interdependencies among items and extrapolate new associations. 
Consequently, books are ideal candidates for recommendation system, by the nature of their data and usage. Although there are packages that exist for recommenders, there are few that are targeted towards specific applications, such as website development- web developers need simplified ML solutions. This package simplifies the process of creating a recommender system for books by integrating multiple algorithms and methods to create a uniform, easy interface for implementation for both content-based and collaborative recommendation systems, depending on the user’s preference.
